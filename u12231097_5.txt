Notes about the Domain Model 
- From what I understand we’ll be working on this part on Sunday
- I think if we can all start thinking of how we would implement the system in code – keeping in mind the different types of relationships and dependencies between objects that would be required it would help when we have to put it as UML. 
- As an example, we could have a User object, which ‘contains’ class local fields and encapsulates a Contact object which stores information like the users email and phone number.
o Then the System class could maintain a linked list or tree (for more comprehensive and efficient searching) of users currently added to the system. 
- NB, that is just an example.
