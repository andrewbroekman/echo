\section{Vision}
The client, Vreda Pieterse from the University of Pretoria, has requested a system to keep track of research publications in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. The scope of the system is manage the administration around the tracking of research publications within the department, however colloboration on research papers is outside of the scope, as currently a version control system is used. The system is required to keep track of all publications and the associated meta data around the publications.

The department currently consists of various research groups, with various contributors, all producing research publications which should be tracked. As the University of Pretoria is rewarded for research produced, it is important for both the heads of the research groups and the Head of the Department to monitor the progress of current publications, as well as gather other metrics to assist in other departamental planning.

The most important requirements as set out by the client are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Monitoring of the research output by the department through metrics by the Head of the Department and heads of research groups
\item Tracking of the status of research publications
\item Be able to produces customized reports based on user defined values
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
This project was commissioned based on the following three problems faced by the client
\begin{itemize}
\item Limitations of current system: \\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The current system used by the client is to use one common Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document to keep track of the status of current research publications. A problem with this solution is that the current solution data integrity issues due to the fact that the current system is not scalable.
	\end{itemize}
\item Increased productivity and transparency
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  A common issue faced by researchers in the Computer Science department, is that an increased workload at due dates lead to the fact the spreadsheet becomes unstable and crashing. This leads to increased downtime, as data recovery is required on the spreadsheet, whcih means that productivity is decreased due to the fact that data entry has to be done multiple times.  This finally leads to the most important issue of any software system, an increase in user frustration.
	\end{itemize}

\item Monitoring and management of funding
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The department receives funding based on research produced. The funding model and hence amount is based on various factors of the research publications, such as whether it is published, presented at a conferance, etc. This makes it thus very important for strategic departamental planning to be able to project the amount as well as type of publications that will be produced in the coming years, as well as to monitor history performance of research groups as whole and even individual researchers.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture requirements}
\subsection{Access channel requirements}
\subsubsection{Human Access Channels}
The human access component must allow for both a web interface and Android application allowing the user to manage their meta data associated with research papers they are involved in. 

The web interface will be the primary contact point for users of the system, as most research papers are created, edited and maintained on personal computers, either owned by the contributor in question or the University of Pretoria. The web application will be based on an MVC based SPA architectural pattern. 

The Android application will be made available in the Android App Store to allow contributors from outside the University of Pretoria, to easily gain access to the system. The Android application should be accessable by all Android device Android version 4.2 and upwards.

\subsubsection{System Access Channels}
All system access will be made over a uniform interface, which will assist in faster development time, ease of maintenance and hence lower overall cost associated with the system. The common interface which will be used, will be a RESTful API based on the the dissertation Architectural Styles and
the Design of Network-based Software Architectures of \textcite{fielding}.  All client side interaction will be done via the web interface or Android application which will in turn use the RESTful API set of the system to accomplish the given task.

\subsection{Quality requirements}
\subsubsection{Performance}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
Application performance can be defined as the amount of work which can be accomplished by an application in question in a measured time interval. The time interval is normally measured in seconds, where the amount of work is defined can be defined as the throughput, latency or data transmission time.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Throughput} \\
		The number of requests and responses which can be processed by the system in a given time interval.
		\item \textbf{Latency} \\
		A time interval measured as the time it takes to service a request. 
		\item \textbf{Data transmission time} \\
		The time it takes to transmit a request to the server from a client or a response from the server to the client. This is heavily influenced by the size of the request, as well as the quality of the network medium.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Our aim for this system, is to increase the throughput and decrease the latency. As we have no control over the network medium used, we are aiming for a minimal request and response payload as to decrease the data transmission time.
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Network requests must be benchmarked and monitored, and aggregate statistics about network requests must be made available.
		\item Function calls must be timed and benchmarked, and this data should be logged.
		\item Precompiled SQL must be used statements.
		\item Network responses should be cached on server side to lighten load on database as well as decreasing the round trip time of request - response.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
The design of this system is largely based on the fact that the current system used by the client is not reliable and suffers from data crashes and data loss, The newly designed system needs to be accessable from both inside the University of Pretoria campus as well as from other networks, espesically other campuses on the TENET network. The system should be reliable in both accessability and the data that the system will be used to calculate contributor perfomance metrics. 
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To enable offline activity and access of data from the Android app, data synced must be made differentiable with timestamps.
		\item The system must resolve synchronization conflicts using timestamps.
		\item Hot swapping of system modules should not affect system service reliability.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Scalability}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
Scalability refers to the application in question's ability to handle an above normal workload for extended time periods and the mechanisms employed to faciliate this.  The client has provided minimum specifications under which the system has to function. However the client has indicated that due to the business requirements, the system will expierence higher loads during the end of the month.
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item System should be able to handle 10 research groups with each research group containing 100 members.
		\item System should be able to facilitate 50 concurrent user sessions at any time.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
Security in application software refers to authentication, authorization, and accounting. Authentication refers to the systems ability to provide a way of identifying a user, normally with a compbination of a username and password combination, or access tokens. Authorization refers to the systems ability to determine whether the user in question has the required authority to execute certain commands or tasks. Finally if the user has been authenticated and has the required authorization, then accounting needs to be done as to be able to determine how the users action has changed the system.  
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item System should be resistant against SQL injections.
		\item A user group hierarchy system should be used to manage user access rights.
		\item Authentication credentials, i.e. username and password should not be stored on Android user device. A token based authentication approach should be utilized so that only tokens are stored on end user device, allowing for the easy revocation of device access if a device is lost. Available technologies, such as OAuth, should be utilized.
		\item Password hosting with a unique salt for each user should be used.
		\item A key derivation function should be used with passwords. 
		\item After N invalid attempts, account should be locked for M min, where N and M would be agreed upon customer and developer based on current best practices.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Flexibility}
Flexibility refers to the ability of the system to be changed dynamically either by hot swapping certain components in a live system, or extending the system with some kind of plugin. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The system should allow unregistered users to use existing third party web service login credentials to register or login to the service.
	\item The system should be decoupled from the database technology it uses, and allow the client to select and change the database it uses in future.
	\item Authentication mechanisms used should be decoupled from the system, allowing them to be interchangeable.
	\item Modules should be decoupled from one another, allowing the system to be extensible without a break in service, by integrating new modules and swapping out existing ones. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The system is to be designed in such a way, that it is easily updated, modified or extable by the client in the future. In order to achieve these requirements, design patterns and best practices such as coding style guides are normally used to ensure uniformaity and modularity across the system.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All code should be documented in the applicable language documentation framework, such as JavaDocs for a Java based system, DOxygen for a C/C++ based system, etc.
		\item A coding style guide/manual should be set up and associated with the project, such that all developers use similar coding styles and conventions, to allow for more readable code that is easier to maintain.
		\item System should be separated in distinct, concise and independent modules relating to separate concerns, to allow for easier maintenance.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Auditability/Monitorability}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Data in database should be always be consistent. This implies that all data should adhere to constraints placed on the data by the data model, such as regex patterns, minimum and maximum length, non nullable fields, etc.
		\item No data should ever be deleted.
		\item It should always be possible to see which user created which objects at what time.
		\item It should always be possible to see which user last changed objects and at what time.
		\item An immutable log of user actions should be kept and should only be accessible by administrative staff.
		\item Logging of stack traces and crash analytics should be implemented in the mobile client, to ensure the developers can see to client reliability.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Integrability}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
The system is should allow for future external integration into other platforms, such as security authentication providers, other external research meta-data databases etc.
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system should allow technology neutral importing and exporting of data.
		\item The backend system should integrate with a desktop web client and Android mobile app clients.
		\item The system should be able to integrate with different backend authentication services.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cost}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
The cost of the system entails any initial aswell as ongoing expenses which the client may incur. Such expenses arise from software licenese, external computing resources required, as well as future maintance of the system, in terms of time.
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item System should be cheap to operate, maintain and extend. If the quality and maturity of technologies available allow it, technologies used must be freely available/usable.
		\item As far as possible, open source compatible, mature technologies should be used, to ensure system stability as far as possible.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Description}
Usability refers to ease human and servers interact with the system in question. Usablility can be measured in various ways, using quantifable scientific measures to more sibjective measures, such as does the API follow convetions, etc.
\item \textbf{Justification}
\item \textbf{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each view in the desktop and mobile clients should be related to a single topic only.
		\item The web client should render properly and be fully functional in modern web browsers.
		\item Mobile devices running Android 4.2 and upwards should be fully supported.
		\item Material design UI guidelines prescribed by Google must be used, to ensure that the clients feel modern and familiar. 
		\item Android and web interface should support the full backend API specifications.
		\item Allow user to elect whether they would like their data to be available offline.
		\item Mobile client users should be able choose between downloading data over Wi-Fi or 3G. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Integration requirements}
The web interface should be accessable by most modern PC's with a modern browser. The website will be making use of an SPA MVC based design which will query a RESTful API, resulting in a very light, mobile and responsive web interface which will it to work accross various devices.

The Android application will be built to work on all Android version 4.2 and upward devices. The mobile application on the Android device should be sensitive to the amount of data that is trasmitted over the network due to the high cost of mobile internet in South Africa. To allow for minimal communcation but maximum functionality and MVC based deisgn will be followed in the Android application design.  Further the use of accessing RESTful API's will allow objects to be transmitted on the wire in a very minimal representation, thereby saving on client bandwidth costs.

The RESTful API will be implemented using the HTTP protocol as a high level protocol. The reason that HTTP is chosen, is that it is a widely supported and deployed protocol, allowing a lot of flexibility. Furmore, most JavaScripts libraries and the Android platform itself has excelleant support for RESTful API's over HTTP.

\subsection{Architecture constraints}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Layered Architectural Pattern
		\item REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Architectural Pattern
		\item Services Orientated Architecture/ Microservices Architecture
		\item Client-Server Architectural Pattern
	\end{itemize}
